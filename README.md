# Dotfiles

Dotfiles are all those `.` files that sit in your `~` and customize your system. Here are mine.

What I like about my dotfiles:

- Nicely Organised
- Multi-Platform MakeFile-based installer
- Standard configuration for every machine I use

# Installation

    # install cross-platform things and dotfiles
    make

    # just the dotfiles
    make dotfiles

    # install os-specific things
    make mac | linux | windows
